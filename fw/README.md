# Firmware
This code _should_ run on any CircuitPython-enabled board, but is most useful when there is >= 4MB of flash.
As of May 2021, it's only been tested on various RP2040 dev boards.

Board-agnostic code lives in the [core](./core) directory. 

Board-specific code - for things like driving indicator LEDs, GPIO mappings - are in other folders. 
Currently supported boards:
* [Pimoroni Tiny2040](./tiny2040)
* [Raspberry Pi Pico](./pico)
* [Adafruit QT Py RP2040](./qtpy2040)
* [Adafruit MacroPad RP2040](./ada-macropad)

There are also [`macos`](./macos)/[`win32`](./win32) folders, which contain mocked IO dependencies so that the firmware can be
tested natively on desktop. *For key press detection on Mac, you'll need to give accessibility permissions to Python*.

## Prepping the firmware for deployment

1. Run `python3 bundle.py` from this directory. This will create a `bundle` directory, which will copy all required files into folders to be loaded onto each board.
2. Find the directory with your board's name in the `bundle` directory. Copy all files/subdirectories onto your CircuitPython device.
3. If your board requires third-party libraries to run this code (most do), you may have to manually copy them. Each board's `bundle` directory will contain a README listing all of the required dependencies. Official CircuitPython libraries available [here](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). As of May 2021, I have been using Bundle version 6.x.
4. If you're using one of the desktop versions, execute `python3 code.py` from the `bundle/[macos/win32]` directory. You'll have to `pip3 install pynput` as well.
5. There is now a `test` target that should run on any machine. This is just a script that simulates the typing of a single word. Execute `python3 code.py` from the `bundle/test` directory to run.

## Customizing the keypad layout

You can customize which letters get attached to each key by changing the `key_map` dictionary in `key_map.py`. The default for English is something like:
```python
key_map = {
    '1' : ['1'],
    '2' : ['a', 'b', 'c'],
    '3' : ['d', 'e', 'f'],
    '4' : ['g', 'h', 'i'],
    '5' : ['j', 'k', 'l'],
    '6' : ['m', 'n', 'o'],
    '7' : ['p', 'q', 'r', 's'],
    '8' : ['t', 'u', 'v'],
    '9' : ['w', 'x', 'y', 'z'],
    '0' : [' ', '0', '\n'],
    '#' : ['.', ',', '?', '!']
}
```
But as [Ben Torvaney discovered](https://torvaney.github.io/projects/t9-optimised.html), you can optimize your typing even further by using something like:
```python
key_map = {
    '1' : ['1'],
    '2' : ['a', 'm', 'r'],
    '3' : ['c', 'd', 'f', 'p', 'u'],
    '4' : ['h', 'n', 'q', 't'],
    '5' : ['i', 'l', 'w', 'y'],
    '6' : ['b', 'e', 'g', 'v', 'x'],
    '7' : ['j', 'k', 'o', 's', 'z'],
    '8' : ['8'],
    '9' : ['9'],
    '0' : [' ', '0', '\n'],
    '#' : ['.', ',', '?', '!']
}
```

**Note that the keypad will not run unless all characters are accounted for!**
